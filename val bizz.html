    <br/>Affiliate marketing is a performance-based strategy where individuals
    <br/> (affiliates) promote products or services for companies (merchants) 
    <br/> and earn commissions for sales generated through their efforts. It offers low start-up costs, 
    <br/> flexibility, and the potential for passive income,
     <br/> making it an attractive option for those looking to monetize their online presence.
